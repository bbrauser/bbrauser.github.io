          <div class="body-text">Board games are a popular past time, not only in the United States but also in other parts of the world as well. They allow us to meet new people or strengthen old relationships, increase our brain function, teach us how to set goals and be patient, reduce stress, and enhance creativity and self-confidence. Games can range from simple to complex, and can include as few as two people and as many as you can fit at your table. There are an abundance of themes that allow you to command an army trying to take over the world to being a cowboy in the wild west. Chances are very good that there is a board game for almost every interest out there, and if thereâ€™s not, the innovation of larger, more established companies like Parker Brothers or Milton-Bradley, as well as smaller, independent companies will almost certainly produce them.</div>
          <div class="body-text">For this study, I utilized a dataset comprised of more than 10,000 board game titles listed on the website BoardGameGeek.com. The following are the variables I used for analysis that are native to the dataset, along with a brief description of them:
    		<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        		<li>YearPublished: the year in which a board game was published.</li>
        		<li>MinPlayers: the minimum number of players required.</li>
        		<li>MaxPlayers: the maximum number of players allowed.</li>
        		<li>PlayTime: the estimated amount of time needed to play in minutes.</li>
        		<li>MinAge: the minimum age requirement in years.</li>
        		<li>RatingAverage: the average rating users of BoardGameGeek.com (BGG) gave the title on a scale of 0-10</li>
        		<li>ComplexityAverage: the average complexity rating BGG gave a title on a scaled of 1-10</li>
        		<li>Domain: the genre of a game</li>
    		</ul>
      </div>
          <div class="body-text">In addition to variables mentioned above, I also created two variables to allow for further analysis of the dataset:
		<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        		<li>Period: the time period in which a game was published (1900-1919, 1920-1939, etc.)</li>
		        <li>Popular: if a board game had an average rating of 7.5 or over, it is considered popular</li>
    		</ul>

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
