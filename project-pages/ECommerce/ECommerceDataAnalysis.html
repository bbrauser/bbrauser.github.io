        <div class="subheader-text">Missing Values</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Now is the time we have to make some decisions about what to do about missing values. Let’s visualize the missing data in a heatmap:</div>
            <div class="gallery-image-container">
              <img src="../assets/images/ECommerce/data_prep7.png" class="gallery-image">
            </div>
          <div class="body-text">Each line above the column names in the heatmap represent a single row of data. Purple indicates that there is a value present, and yellow represents a missing value. As discussed before, CustomerID has about 25% of its data missing. But we can also see that ‘Description’ is missing some values as well. If we use a combination of the isnull() and sum() methods, we can see just how many rows in each column are missing data.</div>
            <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
              <img src="../assets/images/ECommerce/data_prep8.png" class="gallery-image">
            </div>
          <div class="body-text">As expected, InvoiceNo, StockCode, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, and Country have no missing values. There are 1,454 rows missing from Description, making up 0.27% of the column and CustomerID is missing 135,080 rows, or 24.9%.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Now that we know what columns are missing data, we have to make a decision on what to do with those missing rows. There are a myriad of ways that missing data can be handled, but we have to choose the best one for our analysis. One thing to take into consideration is that both of these variables are categorical, so methods like mean/median/mode imputation (filling missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the observed values) or regression imputation (using a regression model to predict and replace missing values based on other variables) would not be appropriate as these are not numerical variables. We could replace the missing data with values from another, similar individual or item, but with variables as unique as CustomerID and Description can be, this would not really be appropriate as well.</div>
          <div class="body-text">For Description, we will simply fill in the missing values with “NO DESCRIPTION AVAILABLE” as less than 1% of the values are missing. Similarly, we are going to use “NO CUSTOMER ID” in CustomerID so we can still make use of the column even though a substantial proportion is missing.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">Date-Time Conversion and Extraction</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The last thing we want to do to clean this data concerns the InvoiceDate column. As of right now, InvoiceDate is a string object. We want to make it a datetime object so we can perform some time series analysis. To do this, we will make use of panada’s to_datetime() method.</div>
            <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">

          <div class="body-text">From this datetime object, we will extract the year, month, day, weekday, and hour and make them new variables. As a note, dt.weekday returns the day of the week with Monday=0 and Sunday=6.</div>
